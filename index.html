    <h3>Mercedes</h3>
    <p>Mercedes returned to Formula One in 1994 as an engine manufacturer in association with Ilmor,
        a British independent high-performance autosport engineering company, which developed their engines.
        The company won one constructors' title and three drivers' titles in a works partnership with McLaren
        which lasted until 2009. In 2005, Ilmor was rebranded as Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains.
        In 2010, the company bought the Brawn GP team, rebranding it as Mercedes. Since a major rule shake-up in 2014,
        which required the use of turbochargers and hybrid electric engines, Mercedes has become one of the most successful
        teams in Formula One history, winning seven consecutive Drivers' titles from 2014 to 2020 and eight consecutive
        Constructors' titles from 2014 to 2021, both records. The manufacturer has also collected more than 200 wins as an 
        engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. Ten Constructors' and thirteen Drivers' Championships
        have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.</p>
        <h3>Ferrari</h3>
        <p>As a constructor in Formula One, Ferrari has a record 16 Constructors' Championships. Their most recent Constructors'
        Championship was won in 2008. The team also holds the record for the most Drivers' Championships with 15, won by nine
        different drivers including Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Mike Hawthorn, Phil Hill, John Surtees, Niki Lauda,
        Jody Scheckter, Michael Schumacher, and Kimi Räikkönen. Räikkönen's title in 2007 is the most recent for the team.
        The 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix marked Ferrari's 1000th Grand Prix in Formula One.</p>
    <h3>Red Bull</h3>
    <p>Red Bull Racing, currently competing as Oracle Red Bull Racing and also known simply as Red Bull or RBR, is a Formula One racing team,
        competing under an Austrian racing licence and based in the United Kingdom. It is one of two Formula One teams owned by conglomerate
        Red Bull GmbH, the other being Racing Bulls. The Red Bull Racing team has been managed by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.</p>
